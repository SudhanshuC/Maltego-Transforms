// A Maltego Machine which extracts emails for a domain and checks if any account related to that has been pwned (using HaveIBeenPwned).
// Special thanks to Troy Hunt for https://haveibeenpwned.com/
// It requires the local transform emailtoHIBP: https://github.com/SudhanshuC/Maltego-Transforms/blob/master/emailtoHIBP.py
